            <h2>Types of Tea</h2>
            <p>
                <span><strong>"True"</strong></span> tea is tea which comes from the Camellia sinensis plant.  Any leaf, root, fruit or flower that comes from a different plant is considered an herbal tea. So Peppermint , camomile and other favourites cannot be considered true tea but rather herbal teas. This is the same for fruit teas, easy right? There are thousands of different teas, with different tastes, aroma and appearances. Despite this all these teas can be categorised into four categories which is determined by the how the tea is processed. These categories are white, green, oolong and black.

            <p>
                The three big factors that determine a teas quality are its growing environment,  variant of crop and processing or the oxidation level of the leaf. The price of tea can vary massively due to these factors, just for a small taste Da Hong Pao also known as Big Red robe tea can cost as much as $600k per pound. $1.4k per gram because of the mountainous region the leave grow in and the unique deep taste. Understanding about quality helps with the appreciation of good blends of tea.
